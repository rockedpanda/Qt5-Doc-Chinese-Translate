<p>Qt includes a number of third-party libraries that are used to provide certain features. Unlike the code described in the <a href="licenses.html">code used in Qt</a> document, these libraries are supplied alongside the Qt modules.</p>
<p>Third Party Software may impose additional restrictions and it is the user's responsibility to ensure that they have met the licensing requirements of the GPL, LGPL, or Qt Commercial license and the relevant license of the Third Party Software they are using.</p>
<p>Run <tt>configure -help</tt> to see any options that may be available for controlling the use of these libraries.</p>
<p>Modifications, if any, done to the third-party libraries can normally be found by reviewing the change history of the corresponding files in the public Qt repository.</p>

          Copyright (C) 2000 by Catharon Productions, Inc.

Introduction
============

  This  license  applies to  source  files  distributed by  Catharon
  Productions,  Inc.  in  several  archive packages.   This  license
  applies  to all files  found in  such packages  which do  not fall
  under their own explicit license.

  This  license   was  inspired  by  the  BSD,   Artistic,  and  IJG
  (Independent JPEG  Group) licenses, which  all encourage inclusion
  and  use of  free  software in  commercial  and freeware  products
  alike.  As a consequence, its main points are that:

    o We  don't promise that  this software works.  However,  we are
      interested in any kind of bug reports. (`as is' distribution)

    o You can  use this software for whatever you  want, in parts or
      full form, without having to pay us. (`royalty-free' usage)

    o You may not pretend that  you wrote this software.  If you use
      it, or  only parts of it,  in a program,  you must acknowledge
      somewhere  in  your  documentation  that  you  have  used  the
      Catharon Code. (`credits')

  We  specifically  permit  and  encourage  the  inclusion  of  this
  software, with  or without modifications,  in commercial products.
  We disclaim  all warranties  covering the packages  distributed by
  Catharon  Productions, Inc.  and  assume no  liability related  to
  their use.

Legal Terms
===========

0. Definitions
--------------

  Throughout this license,  the terms `Catharon Package', `package',
  and  `Catharon  Code'  refer   to  the  set  of  files  originally
  distributed by Catharon Productions, Inc.

  `You' refers to  the licensee, or person using  the project, where
  `using' is a generic term including compiling the project's source
  code as  well as linking it  to form a  `program' or `executable'.
  This  program  is referred  to  as `a  program  using  one of  the
  Catharon Packages'.

  This  license applies  to all  files distributed  in  the original
  Catharon  Package(s),  including  all  source code,  binaries  and
  documentation,  unless  otherwise  stated   in  the  file  in  its
  original, unmodified form as  distributed in the original archive.
  If you are  unsure whether or not a particular  file is covered by
  this license, you must contact us to verify this.

  The  Catharon   Packages  are  copyright  (C)   2000  by  Catharon
  Productions, Inc.  All rights reserved except as specified below.

1. No Warranty

  BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES CAUSED BY THE USE OF OR THE INABILITY TO
  USE THE CATHARON PACKAGE.

2. Redistribution
-----------------

  This  license  grants  a  worldwide, royalty-free,  perpetual  and
  irrevocable right  and license to use,  execute, perform, compile,
  display,  copy,   create  derivative  works   of,  distribute  and
  sublicense the  Catharon Packages (in both source  and object code
  forms)  and  derivative works  thereof  for  any  purpose; and  to
  authorize others  to exercise  some or all  of the  rights granted
  herein, subject to the following conditions:

    o Redistribution  of source code  must retain this  license file
      (`license.txt') unaltered; any additions, deletions or changes
      to   the  original   files  must   be  clearly   indicated  in
      accompanying  documentation.   The  copyright notices  of  the
      unaltered, original  files must be preserved in  all copies of
      source files.

    o Redistribution  in binary form must provide  a disclaimer that
      states  that the  software is  based in  part on  the  work of
      Catharon Productions, Inc. in the distribution documentation.

  These conditions  apply to any  software derived from or  based on
  the Catharon Packages, not just  the unmodified files.  If you use
  our work, you  must acknowledge us.  However, no  fee need be paid
  to us.

  promotional purposes without specific prior written permission.

  We suggest, but do not  require, that you use the following phrase
  to refer to this software in your documentation: 'this software is
  based in part on the Catharon Typography Project'.

  As  you have  not signed  this license,  you are  not  required to
  accept  it.  However,  as  the Catharon  Packages are  copyrighted
  material, only  this license, or  another one contracted  with the
  authors, grants you  the right to use, distribute,  and modify it.
  Therefore,  by  using,  distributing,  or modifying  the  Catharon
  Packages,  you indicate  that you  understand and  accept  all the
  terms of this license.

<h2>The Public Suffix List</h2>
<p><i>The Public Suffix List is an initiative of the Mozilla Project, but is maintained as a community resource. It is available for use in any software, but was originally created to meet the needs of browser manufacturers. It allows browsers to, for example:</i></p>
<ul>
<li><i>Avoid privacy-damaging &quot;supercookies&quot; being set for high-level domain name suffixes</i></li>
<li><i>Highlight the most important part of a domain name in the user interface</i></li>
<li><i>Accurately sort history entries by site</i></li>
</ul>
<p>The public suffix list is used inside Qt to avoid such &quot;supercookies&quot; mentioned above being set in the cookie jar supported by Qt (by the <a href="../qtnetwork/qnetworkcookiejar.html">QNetworkCookieJar</a> class).</p>
<p>See <tt>qtbase/src/network/access/qnetworkcookiejartlds_p.h&#x2e;INFO</tt> for more information about how the list is used.</p>

<h2>IAccessible2 IDL Specification</h2>
<p><i>IAccessible2 is a new accessibility API which complements Microsoft's earlier work on MSAA. This API fills critical accessibility API gaps in the MSAA offering. IAccessible2 was created out of necessity to produce a usable and accessible OpenDocument Format (ODF) based office suite for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. IAccessible2 is an engineered accessibility interface allowing application developers to leverage their investment in MSAA while also providing an Assistive Technology (AT) access to rich document applications such as the IBM Workplace productivity editors and web browsers such as Firefox. The additional functionality includes support for rich text, tables, spreadsheets, Web 2.0 applications, and other large mainstream applications.</i> -- quoted from <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/accessibility/iaccessible2">http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/accessibility/iaccessible2</a>.</p>

GBK not only extended the old standard GB2312 with Traditional Chinese characters, but also with Chinese characters that were simplified after the establishment of GB2312 in 1981. With the arrival of GBK, certain names with characters formerly unrepresentable, like the &quot;rong&quot; (镕) character in former Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's name, are now representable.</i></p>

<h2>Clucene Core Library</h2>
<p><i>CLucene is a C++ port of Lucene. It is a high-performance, full- featured text search engine written in C++. CLucene is faster than lucene as it is written in C++.</i> -- quoted from <tt>qttools/src/assistant/3rdparty/clucene/README</tt>.</p>
<p>The CLucene Core Library uses a dual license strategy for the source code. These licenses are the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) and the Apache License (Version 2.0). Users can choose the license they wish to distribute their software under. This means that you do not need to abide by *both* licenses, but rather than you can choose the license which most suits your needs.</p>
<p>To rephrase this and to make it perfectly clear: CLucene is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) *or* the Apache License, Version 2.0</p>
<p>However, we are an open source project, and we encourage users to use the LGPL license and participate fully in the free software community. Dual licensing of the CLucene source code provides open and free access to the technology both for the GPL community and for other developers or companies that cannot use the GPL.</p>
<p>You can freely modify, extend, and improve the CLucene source code. The only question is whether or not you must provide the source code and contribute modifications to the community. The GNU and Apache licenses allow different ranges of flexibility in this regard, but in the end, regardless of the license used, we highly recommend that you submit any bugs, incompatibilities or added features.</p>
<p>Note that this same license does *not* apply to the CLucene Contributions package. You should read the COPYING file in that directory or package for more information.</p>
