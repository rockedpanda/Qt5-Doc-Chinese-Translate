                            Preamble

  The licenses <span class="keyword">for</span> most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it<span class="operator">.</span>  By contrast<span class="operator">,</span> the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software<span class="operator">-</span><span class="operator">-</span>to make sure the software is free <span class="keyword">for</span> all its users<span class="operator">.</span>

  This license<span class="operator">,</span> the Lesser General Public License<span class="operator">,</span> applies to some
specially designated software packages<span class="operator">-</span><span class="operator">-</span>typically libraries<span class="operator">-</span><span class="operator">-</span>of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it<span class="operator">.</span>  You
can use it too<span class="operator">,</span> but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
<span class="keyword">this</span> license <span class="keyword">or</span> the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular <span class="keyword">case</span><span class="operator">,</span> based on the explanations below<span class="operator">.</span>

  When we speak of free software<span class="operator">,</span> we are referring to freedom of use<span class="operator">,</span>
<span class="keyword">not</span> price<span class="operator">.</span>  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
<span class="keyword">for</span> <span class="keyword">this</span> service <span class="keyword">if</span> you wish); that you receive source code <span class="keyword">or</span> can get
it <span class="keyword">if</span> you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in <span class="keyword">new</span> free programs; and that you are informed that you can <span class="keyword">do</span>
these things<span class="operator">.</span>

  To protect your rights<span class="operator">,</span> we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights <span class="keyword">or</span> to ask you to surrender these
rights<span class="operator">.</span>  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities <span class="keyword">for</span>
you <span class="keyword">if</span> you distribute copies of the library <span class="keyword">or</span> <span class="keyword">if</span> you modify it<span class="operator">.</span>

  For example<span class="operator">,</span> <span class="keyword">if</span> you distribute copies of the library<span class="operator">,</span> whether gratis
<span class="keyword">or</span> <span class="keyword">for</span> a fee<span class="operator">,</span> you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you<span class="operator">.</span>  You must make sure that they<span class="operator">,</span> too<span class="operator">,</span> receive <span class="keyword">or</span> can get the source
code<span class="operator">.</span>  If you link other code with the library<span class="operator">,</span> you must provide
complete object files to the recipients<span class="operator">,</span> so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it<span class="operator">.</span>  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights<span class="operator">.</span>

  We protect your rights with a two<span class="operator">-</span>step method: (<span class="number">1</span>) we copyright the
library<span class="operator">,</span> and (<span class="number">2</span>) we offer you <span class="keyword">this</span> license<span class="operator">,</span> which gives you legal
permission to copy<span class="operator">,</span> distribute and<span class="operator">/</span><span class="keyword">or</span> modify the library<span class="operator">.</span>

  To protect each distributor<span class="operator">,</span> we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty <span class="keyword">for</span> the free library<span class="operator">.</span>  Also<span class="operator">,</span> <span class="keyword">if</span> the library is
modified by someone <span class="keyword">else</span> and passed on<span class="operator">,</span> the recipients should know
that what they have is <span class="keyword">not</span> the original version<span class="operator">,</span> so that the original
author<span class="char">'s reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the &quot;Lesser&quot; General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user'</span>s freedom than the ordinary General
Public License<span class="operator">.</span>  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non<span class="operator">-</span>free programs<span class="operator">.</span>  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License <span class="keyword">for</span> many
libraries<span class="operator">.</span>  However<span class="operator">,</span> the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances<span class="operator">.</span>

  For example<span class="operator">,</span> on rare occasions<span class="operator">,</span> there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library<span class="operator">,</span> so that it becomes
a de<span class="operator">-</span>facto standard<span class="operator">.</span>  To achieve <span class="keyword">this</span><span class="operator">,</span> non<span class="operator">-</span>free programs must be
allowed to use the library<span class="operator">.</span>  A more frequent <span class="keyword">case</span> is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non<span class="operator">-</span>free libraries<span class="operator">.</span>  In <span class="keyword">this</span>
<span class="keyword">case</span><span class="operator">,</span> there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only<span class="operator">,</span> so we use the Lesser General Public License<span class="operator">.</span>

  In other cases<span class="operator">,</span> permission to use a particular library in non<span class="operator">-</span>free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software<span class="operator">.</span>  For example<span class="operator">,</span> permission to use the GNU C Library in
non<span class="operator">-</span>free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system<span class="operator">,</span> as well as its variant<span class="operator">,</span> the GNU<span class="operator">/</span>Linux operating
system<span class="operator">.</span>

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users<span class="char">' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
&quot;work based on the library&quot; and a &quot;work that uses the library&quot;.  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called &quot;this License&quot;).
Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.

  A &quot;library&quot; means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The &quot;Library&quot;, below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A &quot;work based on the
Library&quot; means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term &quot;modification&quot;.)

  &quot;Source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library'</span>s
complete source code as you receive it<span class="operator">,</span> in any medium<span class="operator">,</span> provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to <span class="keyword">this</span> License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of <span class="keyword">this</span> License along with the
Library<span class="operator">.</span>

  You may charge a fee <span class="keyword">for</span> the physical act of transferring a copy<span class="operator">,</span>
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange <span class="keyword">for</span> a
fee<span class="operator">.</span>

  <span class="number">2.</span> You may modify your copy <span class="keyword">or</span> copies of the Library <span class="keyword">or</span> any portion
of it<span class="operator">,</span> thus forming a work based on the Library<span class="operator">,</span> and copy and
distribute such modifications <span class="keyword">or</span> work under the terms of Section <span class="number">1</span>
above<span class="operator">,</span> provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library<span class="operator">.</span>

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change<span class="operator">.</span>

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of <span class="keyword">this</span> License<span class="operator">.</span>

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function <span class="keyword">or</span> a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility<span class="operator">,</span> other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked<span class="operator">,</span> then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that<span class="operator">,</span>
    in the event an application does <span class="keyword">not</span> supply such function <span class="keyword">or</span>
    table<span class="operator">,</span> the facility still operates<span class="operator">,</span> and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful<span class="operator">.</span>

    (For example<span class="operator">,</span> a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well<span class="operator">-</span>defined independent of the
    application<span class="operator">.</span>  Therefore<span class="operator">,</span> Subsection <span class="number">2d</span> requires that any
    application<span class="operator">-</span>supplied function <span class="keyword">or</span> table used by <span class="keyword">this</span> function must
    be optional: <span class="keyword">if</span> the application does <span class="keyword">not</span> supply it<span class="operator">,</span> the square
    root function must still compute square roots<span class="operator">.</span>)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole<span class="operator">.</span>  If
identifiable sections of that work are <span class="keyword">not</span> derived from the Library<span class="operator">,</span>
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves<span class="operator">,</span> then <span class="keyword">this</span> License<span class="operator">,</span> and its terms<span class="operator">,</span> <span class="keyword">do</span> <span class="keyword">not</span> apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works<span class="operator">.</span>  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library<span class="operator">,</span> the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
<span class="keyword">this</span> License<span class="operator">,</span> whose permissions <span class="keyword">for</span> other licensees extend to the
entire whole<span class="operator">,</span> and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it<span class="operator">.</span>

Thus<span class="operator">,</span> it is <span class="keyword">not</span> the intent of <span class="keyword">this</span> section to claim rights <span class="keyword">or</span> contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather<span class="operator">,</span> the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative <span class="keyword">or</span>
collective works based on the Library<span class="operator">.</span>

In addition<span class="operator">,</span> mere aggregation of another work <span class="keyword">not</span> based on the Library
with the Library (<span class="keyword">or</span> with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage <span class="keyword">or</span> distribution medium does <span class="keyword">not</span> bring the other work under
the scope of <span class="keyword">this</span> License<span class="operator">.</span>

  <span class="number">3.</span> You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of <span class="keyword">this</span> License to a given copy of the Library<span class="operator">.</span>  To <span class="keyword">do</span>
<span class="keyword">this</span><span class="operator">,</span> you must alter all the notices that refer to <span class="keyword">this</span> License<span class="operator">,</span> so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License<span class="operator">,</span> version <span class="number">2</span><span class="operator">,</span>
instead of to <span class="keyword">this</span> License<span class="operator">.</span>  (If a newer version than version <span class="number">2</span> of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared<span class="operator">,</span> then you can specify
that version instead <span class="keyword">if</span> you wish<span class="operator">.</span>)  Do <span class="keyword">not</span> make any other change in
these notices<span class="operator">.</span>

  Once <span class="keyword">this</span> change is made in a given copy<span class="operator">,</span> it is irreversible <span class="keyword">for</span>
that copy<span class="operator">,</span> so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy<span class="operator">.</span>

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is <span class="keyword">not</span> a library<span class="operator">.</span>

  <span class="number">4.</span> You may copy and distribute the Library (<span class="keyword">or</span> a portion <span class="keyword">or</span>
derivative of it<span class="operator">,</span> under Section <span class="number">2</span>) in object code <span class="keyword">or</span> executable form
under the terms of Sections <span class="number">1</span> and <span class="number">2</span> above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine<span class="operator">-</span>readable source code<span class="operator">,</span> which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections <span class="number">1</span> and <span class="number">2</span> above on a
medium customarily used <span class="keyword">for</span> software interchange<span class="operator">.</span>

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place<span class="operator">,</span> then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code<span class="operator">,</span> even though third parties are <span class="keyword">not</span>
compelled to copy the source along with the object code<span class="operator">.</span>

  <span class="number">5.</span> A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library<span class="operator">,</span> but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled <span class="keyword">or</span>
linked with it<span class="operator">,</span> is called a <span class="string">&quot;work that uses the Library&quot;</span><span class="operator">.</span>  Such a
work<span class="operator">,</span> in isolation<span class="operator">,</span> is <span class="keyword">not</span> a derivative work of the Library<span class="operator">,</span> and
therefore falls outside the scope of <span class="keyword">this</span> License<span class="operator">.</span>

  However<span class="operator">,</span> linking a <span class="string">&quot;work that uses the Library&quot;</span> with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library)<span class="operator">,</span> rather than a <span class="string">&quot;work that uses the
library&quot;</span><span class="operator">.</span>  The executable is therefore covered by <span class="keyword">this</span> License<span class="operator">.</span>
Section <span class="number">6</span> states terms <span class="keyword">for</span> distribution of such executables<span class="operator">.</span>

  When a <span class="string">&quot;work that uses the Library&quot;</span> uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library<span class="operator">,</span> the object code <span class="keyword">for</span> the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is <span class="keyword">not</span><span class="operator">.</span>
Whether <span class="keyword">this</span> is <span class="keyword">true</span> is especially significant <span class="keyword">if</span> the work can be
linked without the Library<span class="operator">,</span> <span class="keyword">or</span> <span class="keyword">if</span> the work is itself a library<span class="operator">.</span>  The
threshold <span class="keyword">for</span> <span class="keyword">this</span> to be <span class="keyword">true</span> is <span class="keyword">not</span> precisely defined by law<span class="operator">.</span>

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters<span class="operator">,</span> data
structure layouts and accessors<span class="operator">,</span> and small macros and small <span class="keyword">inline</span>
functions (ten lines <span class="keyword">or</span> less in length)<span class="operator">,</span> then the use of the object
file is unrestricted<span class="operator">,</span> regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work<span class="operator">.</span>  (Executables containing <span class="keyword">this</span> object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section <span class="number">6.</span>)

  Otherwise<span class="operator">,</span> <span class="keyword">if</span> the work is a derivative of the Library<span class="operator">,</span> you may
distribute the object code <span class="keyword">for</span> the work under the terms of Section <span class="number">6.</span>
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section <span class="number">6</span><span class="operator">,</span>
whether <span class="keyword">or</span> <span class="keyword">not</span> they are linked directly with the Library itself<span class="operator">.</span>

  <span class="number">6.</span> As an exception to the Sections above<span class="operator">,</span> you may also combine <span class="keyword">or</span>
link a <span class="string">&quot;work that uses the Library&quot;</span> with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library<span class="operator">,</span> and distribute that work
under terms of your choice<span class="operator">,</span> provided that the terms permit
modification of the work <span class="keyword">for</span> the customer<span class="char">'s own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &quot;work that
    uses the Library&quot;, as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user'</span>s computer system<span class="operator">,</span>
    rather than copying library functions into the executable<span class="operator">,</span> and (<span class="number">2</span>)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library<span class="operator">,</span> <span class="keyword">if</span>
    the user installs one<span class="operator">,</span> as <span class="type">long</span> as the modified version is
    interface<span class="operator">-</span>compatible with the version that the work was made with<span class="operator">.</span>

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer<span class="operator">,</span> valid <span class="keyword">for</span> at
    least three years<span class="operator">,</span> to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection <span class="number">6a</span><span class="operator">,</span> above<span class="operator">,</span> <span class="keyword">for</span> a charge no more
    than the cost of performing <span class="keyword">this</span> distribution<span class="operator">.</span>

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place<span class="operator">,</span> offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place<span class="operator">.</span>

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials <span class="keyword">or</span> that you have already sent <span class="keyword">this</span> user a copy<span class="operator">.</span>

  For an executable<span class="operator">,</span> the required form of the <span class="string">&quot;work that uses the
Library&quot;</span> must <span class="keyword">include</span> any data and utility programs needed <span class="keyword">for</span>
reproducing the executable from it<span class="operator">.</span>  However<span class="operator">,</span> as a special exception<span class="operator">,</span>
the materials to be distributed need <span class="keyword">not</span> <span class="keyword">include</span> anything that is
normally distributed (in either source <span class="keyword">or</span> binary form) with the major
components (compiler<span class="operator">,</span> kernel<span class="operator">,</span> and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs<span class="operator">,</span> unless that component itself accompanies
the executable<span class="operator">.</span>

  It may happen that <span class="keyword">this</span> requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that <span class="keyword">do</span> <span class="keyword">not</span> normally
accompany the operating system<span class="operator">.</span>  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute<span class="operator">.</span>

  <span class="number">7.</span> You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side<span class="operator">-</span>by<span class="operator">-</span>side in a single library together with other library
facilities <span class="keyword">not</span> covered by <span class="keyword">this</span> License<span class="operator">,</span> and distribute such a combined
library<span class="operator">,</span> provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted<span class="operator">,</span> and provided that you <span class="keyword">do</span> these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library<span class="operator">,</span> uncombined with any other library
    facilities<span class="operator">.</span>  This must be distributed under the terms of the

  <span class="number">10.</span> Each time you redistribute the Library (<span class="keyword">or</span> any work based on the

You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
&quot;any later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

                            NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
&quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    &lt;one line to give the library'</span>s name and a brief idea of what it does<span class="operator">.</span><span class="operator">&gt;</span>
