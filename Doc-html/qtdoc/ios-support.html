<div class="descr"> <a name="details"></a>
<p>Qt's iOS port allows you to run Qt applications on iOS devices, such as iPhones and iPads.</p>
<a name="getting-started"></a>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>Development and deployment is done using Xcode. The supported workflow is to maintain a <tt>.pro</tt> file based project, export it to Xcode (and re-export when the project setup changes), and then build and deploy using Xcode. We will look at that in more detail in the next section.</p>
<p>The minimum deployment target for Qt applications is iOS 5.0&#x2e; Qt then supports the following devices (iOS might need to be upgraded on some devices).</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhone 3GS and later</li>
<li>iPod Touch third and later generations</li>
<li>iPad 2 and later</li>
<li>iPad Mini</li>
</ul>

<h3>Setting Up the Development Environment</h3>
<p>You can download the Qt 5 installers from the <a href="http://qt-project.org/downloads">Downloads</a> page. For more information, see <a href="gettingstarted.html">Getting Started with Qt</a>.</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>Qt Enterprise packages are available from the <a href="http://qt.digia.com/Try-Buy/">Try Qt Enterprise</a> page. Qt for iOS is also available as part of the Qt Mobile Edition, see <a href="http://qt.digia.com/">qt.digia.com</a> for details.</p><p>Before installing Qt, you first need to install Xcode. You will find it in the Mac App Store <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?ls=1&mt=12">here</a>.</p>
<p><b>Note: </b>As <a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=12172013a">required by Apple</a>, you should always use the latest Xcode 5 version when building your applications for the App Store. In practice this means you need OS X 10.8 or 10.9 to do iOS development with Qt, as those are the only platforms where Xcode 5 will run.</p><p>For running Qt applications in the simulator that comes with Xcode, this is all you need. However, for running applications on a device and publishing your applications in the App Store, you must join the iOS Developer Program (see <a href="https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/">https://developer.apple.com/programs/ios/</a>), and set up developer certificates and provisioning profiles. The easiest solution is to use a profile that takes any App ID (a <tt>*</tt>).</p>
<p>Before building any Qt applications, you should test that Xcode is set up correctly, for example, by running one of the standard Xcode application templates on your device.</p>

<h3>Building Applications From the Command Line</h3>
<p>As mentioned previously, the development workflow on iOS consists of maintaining a normal <tt>.pro</tt> file project and export it to Xcode.</p>
<p>Here is how to build a project:</p>
<ul>
<li>run qmake (if you have not done so previously)</li>
<li>open the resulting <tt>.xcodeproject</tt> file in Xcode</li>
<li>build the application in Xcode</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you must re-import the project if its setup changes, for example, when adding or removing source files.</p>
<a name="building-applications-with-qt-creator"></a>
<h2>Building Applications with Qt Creator</h2>
<p>You can find information on how to set up and run iOS applications in Qt Creator's manual:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://qt-project.org/doc/qtcreator/creator-developing-ios.html">Connecting iOS Devices</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned previously, you must have Xcode installed.</p>
<a name="examples-for-ios"></a>
<h3>Examples for iOS</h3>
<p>In Qt Creator, tested examples on iOS can be looked up. Use the <tt>ios</tt> keyword to search for examples in the Qt Creator Welcome mode. Note that some examples may have limited functionality.</p>
<p>For a list of examples known to work on iOS devices, visit <a href="examples-ios.html">Qt for iOS Examples</a>.</p>
<a name="using-objective-c-code-in-qt-applications"></a>
<h2>Using Objective-C Code in Qt Applications</h2>
<p>Clang, the compiler used for iOS applications, allows mixing C++ and Objective-C code. To enable this mode, suffix your source files with .c mm, and add them to <tt>OBJECTIVE_SOURCES</tt> instead of <tt>SOURCES</tt> in the <tt>.pro</tt> file. This makes it possible to use frameworks from Apple's iOS Developer Library in Qt applications. Most useful is perhaps the possibility for adding In-App Purchasing with the StoreKit framework.</p>
<p>We currently have one example mixing Objective-C and C++ code. You find it <a href="https://qt-project.org/wiki/Mixing_C_and_ObjectiveC_Code">here</a>.</p>
